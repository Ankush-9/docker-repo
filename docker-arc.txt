iDocker Architecture

Docker file —> It’s a place used to specify where the Application Code and Dependencies are present for app execution —>It is required to build Docker Image —>Everything is written here

Docker Image —>It’s like a package which contains code + Dependencies 
It’s like a blueprint or a template 
It contains everything to run the app :code, runtime, libraries, environment variables and configuration files

Docker Registry(official DockerHub) —> It’s used to store Docker images 
DockerHub is a cloud based registry provided by Docker to use pre-built images and to share our images with others 

Docker Container —> It’s a running instance of our image
Containers are lightweight, isolated environments that share the host OS kernel
Whenever a Container is formed, behind the scene it uses the Linux OS

Docker daemon(Docker d) —> Everything is operated in Docker by this core component
It’s a background process that makes docker work
It looks for docker commands(docker run, docker build) and manages images ,containers, networks, and volumes

*Each Container has it’s own networking, where the Docker networking comes into picture
Each container uses it’s own isolated network to get connect to or communicate with outside elements 

Docker Volume is a storage for persistency

Every Image has it’s own version(tag)
