Docker Swarm:

It is an orchestration platform(managing the processes(containers)).
*while Kubernetes is the most popular orchestration tools.

Docker Swarm is used to setup docker cluster(having multiple machines/multiple servers)

Cluster is basically a group of servers/machines.
It is a way to run and manage many docker containers across multiple machines and it will handle where to run each container, load balancing traffic across them and keeping everything in sync.
*Till now we have worked with docker-compose where we had multiple containers in a same machine

Here, we’ll define a service(eg. an app) and Swarm manages its containers and we can easily scale up/down the number of replicas we want(i.e. the containers).

Docker Swarm Cluster Setup~

1—> Master Nodes
2/3 —> Slave(Worker) Nodes

*We can also have any no. of master or worker nodes

—>Create 3/4 EC2 instances(ubuntu used by author) and install docker in all n no. Of instances
—>For Swarm Cluster Communications enable 2377 port in the security group

—>Get Connected to these EC2 VMs and install docker using the following commands
		curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
		sudo sh get-docker.sh
—>Check Docker version
		docker —version
—>For nowhere is no differentiating factor in all 3/4 machines i.e. only naming is provided by us for being master or worker
—>We have to configure 
—>First, we’ll have to set the port no. 2377 before configuring anything 
—>Configure as ~
		sudo docker swarm init —advertise-addr <private-ip-of-vm>
—>The command above gives a message that the current node is the manager(master node)
—>Next up, we also get a command where we have a token to be run on our worker vm to create a cluster with master and slave nodes
—>To add a manager to this swarm, we have to run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.
