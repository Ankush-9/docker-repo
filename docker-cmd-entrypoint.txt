Docker CMD vs ENTRYPOINT:

ENTRYPOINT ~ ENTRYPOINT is used to execute instructions at the time of docker container creation.

Eg.
ENTRYPOINT [“java” ,”-jar” ,”app-name.jar”]

So,What stays the difference between ENTRYPOINT and CMD command?
 —>	Their work is exactly same but,
—>	CMD instructions can be overwritten using the command line arguments where ENTRYPOINT instructions cannot be overwritten rather it appends.

Eg.
docker run my-app —server.port=8080
—>	For a CMD instruction, it would have been overwritten in the main Dockerfile
—>	But,For an ENTRYPOINT, we have a different case as it’s not overwritten but appended to the existing instructions I.e the ENTRYPOINT in Dockerfile is executed and then the arguments are executed
		—>	The final command can be visualised to run as ~ “java”, “-jar”, “app-name.jar”, myapp —server.port=8080

CONCLUSION ~

Use ENTRYPOINT when you want your container to always execute a specific set of instructions.

Use CMD when you want to provide defaults that the user can overwrite.

We can also use both for flexibility together.

COPY ~
 It is used to copy files from our host machine to container

First is Source(Copy from)
And second is the destination(paste to)
Eg.
#COPY jar files from Gradle build output
COPY target/libs/app-name.jar /usr/app/

COPY target/app-name.jar /usr/app/

ADD~
It is also used to copy files from source to destination
 
Add can be used for for copying files from any source to destination making it a more flexible choice making it no just specific to host and container.
We can also add items from the internet by providing the url

eg.
ADD arget/app-name.jar /usr/app/
ADD <http-url> /usr/app/

WORKDIR~
It is used to set working directory for the purpose of directory navigation

eg.
WORKDIR /usr/app


EXPOSE~
It is just to inform container runs on a specific port no. 
eg.
EXPOSE 8080
