Pushing Docker Images:

Our task is to Create a Docker Image and push it to Docker Registry(Docker Hub) account

We’ll be creating a docker file and as soon as we build an image out of it it creates a read only blueprint of our DockerFile

To run this Docker image we use the command ~ docker run <image-name/image-id>
To Stop the execution of container we use ~ docker stop <container-id>
But if the image executed and stopped we’ll have information about it using ~ docker ps -a

To push the image  into a DockerHub account~

—>   Create an account in DockerHub account and remember the username and password.
	To connect to docker hub from VM use the following~
	docker login
	Provide the username and password
	Login is Successful

—>	Now we’ll have to push our image
	We have to tag our image with username
	docker tag <image-name> <username>/<image-name>:v1
	eg. docker tag image-1 ankush6078/image-1:v1
	where v1 specifies the version

—>	tagging is important before pushing the image

—>	Now to push the image use~
	docker push <tag-name>:<version>
	eg. docker push ankush6078/image-1:v1

—>	We have DockerHub as official Docker Registry from Docker
	We do have other options from different providers like amazon,Google etc.

—>	Now go to Your Docker Account —>Open My Hub
	And we’ll have the image added some time ago 

—>	If we don’t specify the version by default docker takes it to be latest

Pulling docker Image :

When we open our pushed image 
Under tags we’ll have a Command to pull the image which is of the format~
	docker pull <tagname>:<version>
	docker pull ankush6078/image-1:v1

The image created is a public repository and if we want it to be private we can perform this as well
Public  ~ Anyone can pull and use it.
