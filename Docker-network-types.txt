Docker Networking:

In general Network is all about communication and Docker network is used to provide isolated network for our containers
If we want to establish communication between containers and internet externally then, Networking is required

We can run multiple containers within one machine
Eg.
Suppose we have a docker server with two containers within it, if we want to establish connection between them we should make sure the two belong to the same network
By default in docker we have three networks available bridge, host and none(by default)
We can also create our own network 
But if container 1 and container 2 belong to different network communication between them is not possible

docker network ls 
Is a command used to check for available networks

We can create our own network by using the following command~
docker network create Ankush-network
Which when reviewed using the “docker network ls” uses the bridge driver behind the scene 

Command to inspect/view information about components is done as~

docker network inspect bridge
docker network inspect Ankush-network

We create containers within networks.

By default the bridge network is used behind the scene for docker containers.It is used to run stand alone containers and it assigns an ip address to that container.

Host network is also used to run standalone containers and it will not assign any ip for the containers.
eg.
docker run -d --network host Ankush
-->Ankush will run directly on host ip and no port mapping is required
It is used when we want to use host port directly.
Usually useful for high performance scenarios

None refers to no network will be available for containers
Eg.
Network run -d —network none myapp
This means a container is created and no network is required for it, it’s a completely isolated network
Mainly used when isolation is required with no network access
i.e. no connectivity required


Docker Network Commands~

docker network ls 
docker network create <netwok-name>
docker network inspect <component-name(network,Driver)>
