Multistage Docker file:

A multi-stage Dockerfile is a Dockerfile that uses more than one FROM statement to build an application in stages.
Because building an app usually needs heavy tools (Maven, Node, Gradle, SDKs),
but running the app only needs a light runtime (JRE, Node runtime, Nginx).

Suppose we are running a java app
We require many things like JDK, JRE,  Gradle, maven or so
Using these altogether finally we create an image
So having all these and more makes the image to be of a bigger size
	—> The bigger the image  size the more difficult is it’s management

For the same app by creating multistage Docker file we can reduce the image Size —> I.e. we achieve a lighter image
In Second stage we only mention what is required, then the remaining things are omitted in the final created image

Eg. size of non-multistage docker file ~ 316mb
	size of same multi-staged docker file ~ 80mb
