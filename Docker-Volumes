Docker Volumes :

Volumes are used to persist data which is generated by docker container and to avoid the data loss
Or 
With the help of docker volumes concept we can make our containers stateful

Practical Scenario —> 
Suppose we have our machine/server within which lies the Docker engine,Here we create a volume i.e. a storage place.We have two containers(for example an application and a database) where we use docker-compose concept.We connect our db container to the Volume.
Our task is to store data in some folder by getting connected (db—>directory)
—> To do so get to docker-compose.yml and perform the configurations under db as~
		volumes:
		  - .app:/var/lib/<db-server-name>d
The Volume connection is defined in the docker-compose.yml
So even if we delete and create a container this part will be executed—>So,everytime we perform creation and deletion this container(mysql) gets mounted to this directory location so, fetching and storage of data is possible
*Mysql db Container accesses old data if present	,even if containers are deleted and re-created

Docker-Volume Commands~
docker volume ls  : Displays Docker volumes available

docker volume create <Volume-name> : Create a new volume with the given name

docker volume inspect <Volume-name> : It is used to inspect the information about a volume

docker volume rm <Volume-name> : It is used to removed a docker volume by given name
