** Docker Compose ~

~Usually in a micro-service app there will be multiple api’s and for every api we may have to create separate containers in that case managing these many containers is a difficult task(create/start/stop)

—>So, as management and maintenance of multiple containers is very difficult we have a concept of docker compose
—>Docker compose is used for defining and running multi-container Docker applications
—>With single command we can start/stop/create multiple-containers

It uses YAML/YML file for configuration of application’s service
—>( docker-compose.yml)
Docker compose file is basically used to specify container information

Whenever we create a Docker compose file, the default and recommended name for it is —> docker-compose.yml 
We can also have a name of our own choice

There are 4 sections within docker-compose.yml file :
version :	It represents compose yml version

services : It represents containers information (image-name , port-mapping ,……)

network : It represents the docker network to run our containers

volumes : It is represented as the containers storage location

=======================================================================

** To use the Docker compose we have to separately perform the installation and the setup ~

Connect to your VM(Amazon Linux Used by the author) and hit the following commands~

sudo curl -L \
"https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" \
-o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

To verify ~ docker-compose —version

======================================================================


Stateful Container and Stateless Container :

Stateful container ~ Data will be there permanently

Stateless container ~ Data will be deleted after container deletion
